# source_code.R for WISE repo
# Engine for both arms of the workflow. Holds no analysis-specific state:

#   1. Plotting and tables            SHARED
#   2. Weighted EM and diagnostics    LCA
#   3. Design and replicate variance  SHARED
#   4. Prediction                     LCA
#   5. LLM labeling                   SHARED
#   6. Weighted EFA and CFA           CFA

# Sections 1, 3 and 5 serve both arms. Nothing in 2 or 4 is called by the CFA
#   report, and nothing in 6 is called by the LCA report, so the two can be
#   edited independently.

# Data cleaning lives in survey_data_read.R and the two method configs.
